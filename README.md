# ♻️ Trash Detection App - YOLOv8

A lightweight waste classification and detection app built using **YOLOv8m** and **Streamlit**, designed to help detect recyclable waste in real-time from images. This project is intended as a prototype for improving environmental waste management using computer vision.

## 📦 Model Overview

| Component      | Details                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Model          | YOLOv8m (Ultralytics)         |
| Epochs         | 150                           |
| Input Size     | 1024 x 1024                   |
| Dataset Source | Kaggle Dataset                |

### 🔍 Performance Summary

| Metric           | Value  |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| mAP\@0.5         | \~0.57 |
| mAP\@0.5:0.95    | \~0.34 |
| Best Epoch       | \~112  |
| Detected Classes | 10     |

> 📉 **Note:** The model shows strong detection on dominant classes (e.g., plastic bottles, paper, cans), but performance drops significantly on underrepresented classes like batteries or styrofoam due to class imbalance and limited examples.
